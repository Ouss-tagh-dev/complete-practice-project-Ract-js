Name-and-Age Validator
This React mini-app is a simple and efficient tool for validating and storing name and age values. With just two input fields, one for the name and one for age, this app provides an easy-to-use interface for users who need to input, validate, and store name and age values with minimal hassle.

If the user enters an invalid value or an age less than zero, the app automatically displays an error modal that requires the user to click "ok" to dismiss it. Otherwise, the app adds the name and age values to a todo list in the format "name (X age)."

This app is perfect for developers who need a quick and efficient solution for managing user input values. With its streamlined design and user-friendly interface, this mini-app is an excellent choice for anyone looking to validate and store name and age values with ease.
